Just walked out of the theater after seeing Ad Vitam and my brain's still swirling. It's like when you eat a whole tub of ice cream, and you’re kinda full and maybe regretful but also strangely satisfied. I mean, eternal life, really? That's a commitment even Tinder can’t prepare you for. 

The film's got this vibe where it’s all slick and shiny, but kinda makes you want to scream into the abyss. And the colors — why do futuristic movies always use so much blue light? Makes me think we're all destined to live in a permanent cold swimming pool. 

Anyway, it was weirdly hypnotic, like when your computer screen freezes and you're stuck staring at the loading icon, waiting for something to make itself clear. Good acting though. Martha and those soulful eyes... pure digital poetry. But if I had to listen to another existential monologue, I’d probably start questioning my choice of breakfast cereal.

>Loved how it makes you think about immortality — you know, would I really want to spend eternity downloading cat videos? But then the whole mystery and the society living forever, it’s like a never-ending episode of some sci-fi soap opera, where characters are basically philosophical memes with legs. Deep thoughts, but do they even lead anywhere? Not sure. 

Here’s something random that came to mind; why do characters in movies set in the future always wear weird clothes? Like, are capes making a comeback amidst all this tech stuff? Who knew immortality came with a side of bad fashion sense.

```cpp
bool liveForever(bool questioningLife) {
    if (questioningLife) {
        return false;
    }
    return true;
}
```

So, if you’re into a mix of immortality, teenagers with serious trust issues, and need a break from reality, watch the movie, or y'know, download it if facing another cinema trip feels too much like hard work. Not that I’m recommending illegal downloads or anything (wink wink). Maybe I'll watch it again once my brain's had a nap. Infinity's overrated if you ask me.
